                <p class="fill">Now I will explain clearly about my hometown (hopefully). So as in the image on the left you guys might have already noticed what city it is. Yup it is Sibolga, a city located in the natural harbour of Sibolga Bay on the west coast of North Sumatra province, in Indonesia. Again, that is a joke hehe, I lived at Jakarta and this phallic monument you are seeing is the national monument, the most well-known landmark of my city. Aside from the monument, Jakarta also had another “trait” that no other city could compare which is the fact that Jakarta once ranked #1 on index of cities with the highest levels of air pollution in the world on the 1st of august 2019.</p>
