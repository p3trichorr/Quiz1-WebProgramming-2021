            <h2>Ketoprak</h2>
            <p>Starting with my favorite dish which is ketoprak, a mixture vegetables, tofu, scrambled egg and peanut sauce, this cuisine never fails to escalate my gluton side. It is available in a lot of street food vendors and a must have when visiting Jakarta.</p>

            <h2>Soto Betawi</h2>
            <p>In Indonesia, there are a lot of Soto from different regions with each and everyone one of them having different taste and recipies, my first ranking Soto in Indonesia is Soto Betawi (with kantin pusat soto as its second rank). Soto is a bit different then any other Soto as it uses coconut essence in its recipe.</p>

            <h2>Martabak Manis</h2>
            <p>My last best dessert is martabak which is a sweet dessert most Indonesians love. It comes with a lot of toppings ranging from chocolate to Nutella, the martabak has an endless potential of toppings with the initial base that could also be added with pandan or red velvet topping. </p>
