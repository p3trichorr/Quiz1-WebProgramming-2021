            <h2>Aesthetic Element Monument</h2>
            <p>A contemporary statue located in front of the most “corrupted” building in Indonesia. This statue is a symbol of the incarnation of the true Indonesian man, the wishes and hopes that are conveyed through the people's representative institutions. Although this wish is not being represented by the people inhabiting the building near this monument, the monument still has a lot of visitors. Though their intentions are still unclear, this monument is often visited by college student and some “upset” civilians. They usually came together as a group to, lets just say, “enjoy” the beauty of this monument which sometimes is not allowed to enter by the authorities and being left hanging at the gates for hours. </p>
