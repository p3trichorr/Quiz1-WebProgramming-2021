                <p class="fill">Hi everyone, so in this page I am told to introduce myself. So, allow me to do so. My name is Zulfiqar Rahman Aji, I am a 20 years old student in the informatics engineering and welcome to my ted talk. No, just kidding this isn’t a ted talk, well I am not even talking right now. You are reading my thoughts I put on this page and that’s that. Anywayss where was I, oh okay my profile, so aside from being a student in ITS I am also a student of UTM Malaysia! yet, I was going for an exchange there in the next semester if everything goes according to plan, a bit of an “in-advance claim” but I was already accepted so might as well just boast it here right now hehe. Apparently this paragraph have been ridiculously long I will now end it here, thank you for the time you wasted reading this words and don’t forget to share, lek and subrek.</p>
